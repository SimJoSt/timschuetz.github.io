###### Synopsis
This is a short student documentary film that takes its audience to quite a hidden place within Turkey’s metropolis: the Istanbul Hackerspace. Based on an ethnographic approach, our aims was to shed light onto a contemporary hacker institution that is proud to be the first in the Middle East. In total, we immersed ourselves into the projects and weekly activities of its members for three months. The outcome are brief portraits of people that try to navigate a growingly authoritarian political climate on the one hand, as well as techno-optimism and economic hype on the other.

In the course of the film, our protagonists challenge the stereotype of hackers as criminals and data thieves. Instead, they articulate many different interpretations of what hacking as a practice can or should be. Examples include a tiny do-it-yourself detector that challenges excessive tear gas usage by Turkish police forces; learning how to program the world's tiniest computer; or simply having a place to chat about your next start up project over a tasty 'hacker soup'. All this, and much more, can be found in the Istanbul Hackerspace.

###### Background
