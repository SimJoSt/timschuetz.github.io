###### Synopsis

Within mainstream media, the figure of the hacker as criminal, thief and techno-outlaw is a common stereotype. What is hidden behind this representation, is the growing diversity of hacker subjectivities, projects and movements. As an ethnographic short film, 'Beep Beep' offers a glimpse by juxtaposing two contemporary technology communities in the Austrian capital, Vienna. On the one hand, one encounters the MetaLab, a hackerspace that has been open for over a decade, offering everything from weekly lectures, hackathons and massive laser cutting equipment. On the other, there is Mz Baltazars Laboratory, a feminist technology workshop promoting hands-on engagement with technology as highly gendered practice. Together, they enable a discussion on the future of hacker spaces that push the boundaries between tech, craftiness, artwork and the need for safe(r) spaces of encounter.

###### Background

The film was shot by Victoria Paar, Sara Rahnenführer and Tim Schütz for the 2017 edition of the Ethnocineca film workshop under the theme 'Radical Minds'. In May 2017, film was premiered as part of the Ethnocineca Documentary festival at the Votiv Cinema, Vienna.
