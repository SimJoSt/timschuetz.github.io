## Fall is coming

At least, that is what my current enrollment status says. Since late September, I am now officially a Master's student at the University of California, Irvine. The institution runs on a quarter-system, which gives me another winter, spring and summer period to look forward to. With about ten weeks each, the turnaround seems incredibly short. Certainly one of the many new things to get used to around here. Like the presence of palm trees, which to me communicate anything but fall.
