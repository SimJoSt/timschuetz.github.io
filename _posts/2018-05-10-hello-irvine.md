## Fall is coming

At least, that is what my current enrollment status says. Since late September, I am now officially a Master's student at the University of California, Irvine. The institution runs on a quarter-system, which gives me another winter, spring and summer period to look forward to. With about ten weeks each, the turnaround seems incredibly short. Certainly one of the many new things to get used to around here. Like the presence of palm trees, which to me communicate anything but fall.

After the first three weeks of settling in – including the three important B's: bed, bicycle, and bank account – I decided to gather some of my impressions in this blog. The whole website itself runs on Jekyll, GitHub pages, and a great theme I spent way too many hours shopping around for. I guess that's my way of virtually settling in. Yet, I also want to use this space to document my academic experience by covering events, research, and sketching ideas.

In the beginning, I was struck by the tranquility of the city. With roughly over 200,000 inhabitants, Irvine fulfills many characteristics of how I imagined suburban America at large. My first walks through along the wide streets, densely populated parking lots, and plastic-like shopping plazas seemed both soothing and unsettling at once. Only when I got a used bike off of _craigslist_ and started exploring the surroundings, I began to develop a sense of place. Located in Southern California, Irvine is only a 40 minute bike ride to Newport Beach, a 60 minute train ride to Los Angeles and managable driving distance to San Diego. But also within the city limits there is quite an astounding number of bike and hiking trails.
